**Prerequisite**
* required PHP >= 7.1

**My Process**

***Initial BruteForce Approach***
* set up Controller to handle route request 
* use load for recipe and rating csv into cache and use as data source
* create modal for ratings and recipe
* overwrite Modal method for saving and updating new values
* write unit test to cover the routes and make sure it returns a json string

*Q&A*

How to use your solution
* Make sure you are in the root folder - recipe
* Execute 'php composer.phar install' to install vendor library
* start server using 'php -S localhost:8000 -t public/'
* api documentation available here https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/952945/collection/RVtxKCRV

 
Reasons for your choice of web application framework
* Lumen is fast, lightweight micro-framework for writing RESTful APIs.
* it is an ideal choice because we donâ€™t need stuff like sessions, templates and other features of full stack 
applications.


Explain how your solution would cater for different API consumers that require different recipe data e.g. a mobile app and the
front-end of a website
* you can apply versioning to the api, such that you have 
* http://localhost:8000/mobile/v1/api/recipes/1
* http://localhost:8000/web/v1/api/recipes/1

Anything else you think is relevant to your solution
* current implementation is missing an authentication layer
* current implementation using php built in server however for production we require 
nginx or apache
